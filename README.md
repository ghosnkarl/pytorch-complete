## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pytorch-complete.git
cd pytorch-complete
```

2. Set up your environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv pytorch-env
source pytorch-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: pytorch-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start with the basics in `01_basics/01_tensor_operations.ipynb` and progress through the curriculum.

## üíª Code-First Approach

This course takes a **code-first approach** to learning deep learning with PyTorch:

- **Implementation Focus**: Each notebook emphasizes working code over mathematical derivations
- **High-Level Theory**: Just enough theory to understand the concepts without getting lost in equations
- **Practical Examples**: Learn by doing with code samples you can run, modify and experiment with
- **Visual Explanations**: Complex concepts are explained with diagrams and visualizations rather than formulas
- **Ready-to-Use Patterns**: Copy, adapt, and reuse implementation patterns for your own projects

This approach makes deep learning accessible to developers who want to build practical applications without requiring an advanced mathematics background.

## üìä Learning Path Progression

For optimal learning, follow this recommended sequence:

1. Complete the notebooks in `01_basics/` to build a solid foundation through practical code examples
2. Move to `02_computer_vision/` to learn image processing implementation techniques
3. Continue with `03_nlp/` for text processing code patterns and solutions
4. Explore `04_gans/` and `05_segmentation/` for specialized implementation approaches
5. Study `06_transformers/` for state-of-the-art architectures with working code
6. Apply your implementation skills in the projects section
7. Reference the utils as needed throughout your hands-on learning journey

## üîß Prerequisites

- Intermediate Python programming knowledge
- Basic familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Minimal mathematical background required - we focus on implementation rather than derivations
- Enthusiasm for learning through code examples and hands-on practice
