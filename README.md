# PyTorch — Complete Learning Path 🚀

A structured, code-focused guide for mastering PyTorch, from fundamentals to advanced deep learning applications.  
Built for developers who prefer learning by doing.

---

## 📚 What’s Inside

**Code-First, Project-Based Curriculum**

- ✅ **Tensor Basics → Neural Networks → Autograd**
- ✅ **Computer Vision (Classification, Detection, Segmentation)**
- ✅ **Generative Models (GANs)**
- 🔄 **Natural Language Processing (Coming Soon)**
- 🔄 **Transformers (Coming Soon)**
- 🔄 **End-to-End Projects (Coming Soon)**

We focus on **practical implementations** over theory-heavy explanations.  
Just enough math to understand the ideas.
